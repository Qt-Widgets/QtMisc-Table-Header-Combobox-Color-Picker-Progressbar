# Miscellaneous Qt Widgets

Various small Qt Widgets which add additional functionality or work around Qt limitations.

* **ColorPickerDelegate**: a QAbstractItemDelegate which draws a color picker button with an inset to indicate transparency.
* **ComboBoxDelegate**: a QStyledItemDelegate which draws a QComboBox with its own item model.
* **DockWidgetProxyStyle**: a QProxyStyle which does some customization of QDockWidget drawn by QFusionStyle, including setting custom icons and filling the background.
* **ExtendedComboBox**: sets a fixed popup height for the QComboBox drawn by QFusionStyle.
* **FilterHeaderView**: proof-of-concept QHeaderView which draws a custom sort indicator icon for each column, and provides an 'auto filter' style menu for each section similar to Microsoft Excel.
* **ProgressBarDelegate**: a QStyledItemDelegate which draws a QProgressBar without the outer groove, to better match Qt item view styles.
